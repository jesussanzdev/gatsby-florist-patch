To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging. Only refunds for defective goods or inaccurate orders will be entertained. Be sure to measure your size accurately to prevent such instances from occurring.

To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.</p>

There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted (if applicable)

Any item not in its original condition is damaged or missing parts for reasons not due to our error.</p>

<h2>Refunds (if applicable)</h2>

<p>Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.

If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.</p>


<h2>Late or missing refunds (if applicable)</h2>

<p>If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.

Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.</p>
