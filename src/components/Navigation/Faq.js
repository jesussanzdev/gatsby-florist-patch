<h3><p>When will my order be processed?</p></h3>

<p>We process orders between Monday and Friday. Orders will be processed within 3-5 business days from the order date and shipped the next day after the processing day. Please note that we don't ship on weekends.</p>

<p>If you need to change or cancel your order, please contact us immediately. Once your order has been processed, we will be unable to make any changes.</p>

<h3><p>How long will it take to receive my order?</p></h3>

<p>Please allow up to 1 week for your order to process, and an additional 3 days to be shipped out. Our fulfilment centers are located around the world. For domestic orders in the United States, it will normally take about 1-3 weeks. For International orders, please allow up to 3-4 weeks.</p>

<h3><p>I ordered two products, but have received only one... what's happening?</p></h3>

<p>Since we have a large assortment of products that are not stored in the same warehouse, it is possible that some products get shipped separately. Do not worry, it is quite normal that you receive a product a few days before the other.</p>

<h3><p>I recently ordered my The Flower Patch product. How do I track my order?</p></h3>

<p>Within a week of your order being fulfilled (shipped), you will receive notification of your tracking number.</p>

<h3><p>I'm living in a rural area. Are you able to ship to me?</p></h3>

<p>Yes! We provide FREE International Shipping regardless of where you are located.</p>

<h3><p>Is your website secure with my personal information?</p></h3>

<p>Absolutely! We use SSL security to ensure all your personal information is encrypted. We do not store your credit card information and it will be used one-time only upon purchasing your product. We never store any information about our customer's private details!</p>

<h3><p>How can I contact you?</p></h3>

<p>Send us an email to the following address: info@theflowerpatch.com. We will reply as soon as we can!</p>
